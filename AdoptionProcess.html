                    <p>
                        We make every effort to make the adoption process fun and seemless at Steven's County Animal Shelter! 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In order to ensure that all pets are going to loving and competent home, we do have a few requirements.

                <h1>Adopt and have a positive impact on your community</h1>
                    <p>
                        When you make the choice to adopt a pet, instead of purchasing from a breeder, you are giving our pets a second chance at life! To keep the community and the pets at Steven's County Animal Shelter safe, we spay/neuter all animals and microchip them. In addition, all animals are kept up to date on their vaccinations. We ask that all prospective pet owners keep their pets healthy with regualr check-ups with a veterinarian.
                    </p>
                <h1>The Adoption Application</h1>
                    <p>
                        If you have discovered an animal that you are interested in adopting, please fill out an application! Application can be found at our front desk. After submitting you application, we will start the review process. This process is affecting by a number of different factors.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The most common factors we take into account are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The number of adoption requests for the animal being applied for</li>
                        <li>The number of pets in your household</li>
                        <li>The animal's disposition towards children/other animals (if applicable) </li>
                        <li>The Adoption and pet ownership history of applicant</li>
                    </ul>
                <h1>Thank You for Supporting Our Shelter</h1>
                    <p>
                        We appreciate all the love and support that we receive in our community! Even if you cannot adopt a pet, please consider other ways to contribute. We accept donations in many forms, including food, toys, and supplies. We are also gracious to those willing to volunteer! It is a great way to gain volunteer hours for students, and spending time with animals can be theraputic and stress-relieving!</p>
