            <h2>Explore our site</h2>
            <p>
                We here at Steven's County animal shelter want you to explore our site, so we can find these animals a home. Humans make the life of an animal by caring and loving on them. These animals will not be able to enjoy a good life if people do not choose to adopt them. The Steven's County Animal Shelter has a lot of animals who have either just arrived or have been at the shelter for over a month. Please help us find these animals a loving and caring home.

            <h2>Benefits of adopting a pet</h2>
            <img src="images/choco_pet.jfif" alt='Chocolate Lab' class="floatRight">
            <ul>
                <li><b>You are saving a life</b> - Adopting a pet allows us to take more pets, so adopting a pet allows us to take in another pet that has been lost, abused, etc. </li>
                <li><b>You will save money</b> - we will ensure that your pet is up to health before you take your animal home</li>
                <li><b>More love in your household</b> - Animals bring out the love in your children for the pet, so having a pet in your home will bring out more love in your children (and even you)</li>
                <li><b>Animals are often housetrained</b> - The animals are shelter takes in are usually older than puppies so the majority of the time the animals have left a previous family and are already housetrained</li>
                <li><b>Unconditional love</b> - many pets in our shelter have had a non-ideal life, so having an owner that truly loves them will bring out love in a pet because you adopted them</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Donations</h2>
            <p>
                If you would like to donate to help out the animal shelter (Donations help us take in more animals!), then please come by our office at 13640 W Solano Dr Litchfield Park, Arizona between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm Monday through Friday.
